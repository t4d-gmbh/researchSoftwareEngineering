## Template Repository

Because the root structure and core configuration files of most projects share a highly consistent layout, the creation of a standardized project template is highly recommended.
Utilizing a template eliminates the repetitive process of manually recreating scaffolding, ensuring that every new endeavor begins with best practices already in place.

By defining a baseline architecture — complete with placeholder directories, standard configuration files (such as `pyproject.toml` or `.gitignore`), and foundational documentation — consistency is maintained across multiple projects.
This approach drastically reduces initial setup time, prevents structural drift between different analyses, and ensures that critical components like licensing and dependency management are never overlooked.

A pre-configured template repository is provided below.
It is designed to serve as a comprehensive, ready-to-use foundation for any Python-based project:
