## 📝 Homework

:::{admonition} Due next session
:class: important
Continue and finish both exercises, then push to your fork.
:::

- Separation of concerns in place (`.env`, `config/`, `src/`, `scripts/`, `data/README.md`)
- Script split into data retrieval, preprocessing, and training
- Reusable functions live in `src/`
- `scripts/` files are short orchestration — mostly function calls
- No duplicated parameters, no commented-out code
